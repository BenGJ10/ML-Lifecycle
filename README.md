# Complete ML Lifecycle

This document provides an overview of tools and practices for managing the complete machine learning lifecycle, from data collection to model deployment and monitoring.

## MLFlow

MLFlow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It provides tools for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

### Key Features
- **Experiment Tracking**: Log and query experiments to understand model performance.
- **Model Registry**: Store and manage models in a central repository.              
- **Project Packaging**: Package code and dependencies for reproducibility.
- **Deployment**: Deploy models to various environments, including cloud and on-premises.

## Data Version Control (DVC)

Data Version Control (DVC) is a tool for managing machine learning projects, particularly those involving large datasets and complex workflows. It allows you to version control your data, models, and experiments in a way similar to how Git works for code.

### Key Features
- **Data Versioning**: Track changes in datasets and models over time.
- **Experiment Management**: Run and compare experiments with different parameters and configurations.
- **Pipeline Management**: Define and manage data processing pipelines.
- **Collaboration**: Share datasets and models with team members easily.
