# Complete ML Lifecycle

This document provides an overview of tools and practices for managing the complete machine learning lifecycle, from data collection to model deployment and monitoring.

## MLFlow

MLFlow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It provides tools for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

### Key Features
- **Experiment Tracking**: Log and query experiments to understand model performance.
- **Model Registry**: Store and manage models in a central repository.              
- **Project Packaging**: Package code and dependencies for reproducibility.
- **Deployment**: Deploy models to various environments, including cloud and on-premises.
- **Integration**: Works with popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
- **User Interface**: Provides a web-based UI for visualizing experiments and models.
- **APIs**: Offers REST APIs and SDKs for integration with other tools and workflows.
- **Artifact Management**: Store and manage artifacts like datasets, models, and logs.
- **Scalability**: Supports distributed training and large-scale deployments.

## Data Version Control (DVC)

Data Version Control (DVC) is a tool for managing machine learning projects, particularly those involving large datasets and complex workflows. It allows you to version control your data, models, and experiments in a way similar to how Git works for code.

### Key Features
- **Data Versioning**: Track changes in datasets and models over time.
- **Experiment Management**: Run and compare experiments with different parameters and configurations.
- **Pipeline Management**: Define and manage data processing pipelines.
- **Collaboration**: Share datasets and models with team members easily.
- **Storage Agnostic**: Supports various storage backends, including local file systems, cloud storage, and remote servers.
- **Integration with Git**: Seamlessly integrates with Git for version control of code and data.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures that experiments can be reproduced with the same data and code versions.
- **Large File Support**: Handles large files efficiently without bloating the Git repository.
- **CLI and API**: Provides a command-line interface and Python API for easy integration into workflows.

## BentoML

BentoML is a framework for serving machine learning models. It simplifies the process of deploying models as APIs, making it easy to integrate them into applications.
Build once, deploy anywhere.

BentoML allows you to package machine learning models into "Bento" bundles, which can be deployed as REST APIs or gRPC endpoints. It supports various machine learning frameworks and provides tools for managing model versions, dependencies, and deployment configurations.
BentoML also includes a web-based UI for monitoring and managing deployed models, making it easier to track performance and usage metrics.




### Key Features
- **Model Serving**: Serve models as REST APIs or gRPC endpoints.
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Supports models from various frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
- **Deployment Options**: Deploy models to cloud platforms, Kubernetes, or on-premises servers.
- **Model Management**: Version and manage models easily.   
- **Monitoring**: Track model performance and usage metrics.
- **Integration**: Easily integrate with existing applications and workflows.
- **Scalability**: Handle high traffic and scale deployments as needed.
- **Security**: Provides options for securing model endpoints and data.
- **Customizable**: Extend functionality with custom code and plugins.
- **CLI and SDK**: Provides a command-line interface and SDK for easy model management and deployment.
